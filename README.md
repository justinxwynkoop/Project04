Allow the user to choose one of "Music", "Movie", and "Software" as the entity from a drop down list. The user selects an entity, enters a search term, and then clicks the Search button. Upon clicking the Search button, the search results should be displayed in a table. Upon clicking any search result, more information should be displayed about the result. Provide appropriate navigation for the user.
